Simple nbody code to simulate a 2D set of particles
using a cell neighbor locator as implemented in OpenKIM.
Has OpenGL display capabilities and is reasonably fast.

CUDA version is found in the cuda folder.

Options in the Makefile so that it works easily
with other systems (edit as necessary):
    DOPLOT - display with opengl
    FPS    - calculate frames per second (not portable)
    POINTS - make the opengl display points, not fancy circles

simply use to compile: 
    make
